<h2 id="Work GPT"> How does ChatGPT work?</h2>   
 <p>ChatGPT is the latest language model from OpenAI. Similarly to many Large Language Models, ChatGPT is capable of generating text in a wide range of styles and for different purposes.
        It represents the next generation in OpenAI's line of Large Language Models, and it is designed with a strong focus on interactive conversations. The creators use a particular technique 
        called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which uses human feedback in the training loop to minimize harmful, untruthful, and/or biased outputs.</p>
