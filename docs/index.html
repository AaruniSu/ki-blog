      What is AI? <br>
      <p> AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is essentially software that can learn patterns from information. Using patterns from existing and new data, AI makes predictions to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.It involves the creation of algorithms and models that enable machines to mimic and automate human-like cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI’s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones. But some AI systems are designed to learn without supervision — for instance, by playing a video game over and over until they eventually figure out the rules and how to win.</p>
      <p>AI can be categorized into two main types: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks within a limited domain. Examples of narrow AI include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation systems, and image recognition software. These systems excel at their predefined tasks but lack the ability to generalize beyond their specific domain.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, general AI, also known as strong AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), aims to replicate human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks and exhibit a broad understanding of the world. General AI systems would have the capability to reason, learn, understand natural language, and adapt to new situations similar to human intelligence. However, achieving true general AI is still a work in progress, and no fully autonomous general AI systems currently exist.</p>
      <p>AI is implemented through various techniques and approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on training algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data and extract meaningful representations.</p>
