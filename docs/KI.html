   <h2 id="AI"> What is AI?  </h2>  
   
    <p> AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is essentially software that can learn patterns from information. Using patterns from existing and new data, AI makes predictions to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.It involves the creation of algorithms and models that enable machines to mimic and automate human-like cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI’s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones. But some AI systems are designed to learn without supervision — for instance, by playing a video game over and over until they eventually figure out the rules and how to win.</p>
    <p>AI can be categorized into two main types: <br> narrow AI and general AI. <b>Narrow AI </b>, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks within a limited domain. Examples of narrow AI include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation systems, and image recognition software. These systems excel at their predefined tasks but lack the ability to generalize beyond their specific domain.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, general AI, also known as <b> strong AI</b> or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), aims to replicate human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks and exhibit a broad understanding of the world. General AI systems would have the capability to reason, learn, understand natural language, and adapt to new situations similar to human intelligence. However, achieving true general AI is still a work in progress, and no fully autonomous general AI systems currently exist.</p>
    <p>AI is implemented through various techniques and approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on training algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data and extract meaningful representations. AI reduces Human erors 
        and makes unbias, smart decisions.

    <h2 id="AI work"> How does AI work?</h2> 
    To put it simply, AI works by combining large data sets with intuitive processing algorithms. AI can manipulate these algorithms by learning behavior patterns within the data set.
It’s important to understand that AI is not just one algorithm. Instead, it is an entire machine learning system that can solve problems and suggest outcomes.
<p>Take a customer service chatbot, for example. After you type a question, the chatbot uses an algorithm – or a set of rules  – to recognize keywords and identify what kind of help you need. The chatbot improves over time as it interacts with new customers and receives more data.

   <h2 id="Impact"> What impact does data have on an AI ?</h2>
   Data quality is crucial in artificial intelligence because it directly impacts the performance, accuracy, and reliability of AI models. High-quality data enables models to make better predictions and produce more reliable outcomes, fostering trust and confidence among users.

</p>
Ensuring data quality also means addressing biases present in the data, which is essential to avoid perpetuating and amplifying these biases in AI-generated outputs. This helps to minimize unfair treatment of specific groups or individuals. <br>
Furthermore, a diverse and representative dataset enhances an AI model’s ability to generalize well across different situations and inputs, ensuring its performance and relevance across various contexts and user groups. Ultimately, maintaining data quality is key to realizing the full potential of AI systems in delivering value, driving innovation, and ensuring ethical outcomes.
