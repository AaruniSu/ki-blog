   <h2 id="machine">What is machine learning? </h2> 
   Machine Learning is an AI technique that teaches computers to learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases. 
   Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning.
   <p>Machine learning uses two types of techniques: <b>supervised learning</b> , which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, and <b>unsupervised learning</b> , which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.</p>

   <h3 id="h3" >Supervised Learning </h3>
   Supervised machine learning builds a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output) and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data.
    Use supervised learning if you have known data for the output you are trying to predict. <br>
    Supervised learning uses classification and regression techniques to develop machine learning models.
    <p><b>Classification</b>  techniques predict discrete responses—for example, whether an email is genuine or spam, or whether a tumor is cancerous or benign. Classification models classify input data into categories. Typical applications include medical imaging, speech recognition, and credit scoring.
  Use classification if your data can be tagged, categorized, or separated into specific groups or classes. For example, applications for hand-writing recognition use classification to recognize letters and numbers. In image processing and computer vision, unsupervised pattern recognition techniques are used for object detection and image segmentation.</p>

  <p><b>Regression techniques</b> predict continuous responses—for example, hard-to-measure physical quantities such as battery state-of-charge, electricity load on the grid, or prices of financial assets. Typical applications include virtual sensing, electricity load forecasting, and algorithmic trading.
    Use regression techniques if you are working with a data range or if the nature of your response is a real number, such as temperature or the time until failure for a piece of equipment.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="h3" > Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data. It is used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.
<p><b>Clustering</b>  is the most common unsupervised learning technique. It is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or groupings in data. Applications for cluster analysis include gene sequence analysis, market research, and object recognition.
</p>

For example, if a cell phone company wants to optimize the locations where they build cell phone towers, they can use machine learning to estimate the number of clusters of people relying on their towers. A phone can only talk to one tower at a time, so the team uses clustering algorithms to design the best placement of cell towers to optimize signal reception for groups, or clusters, of their customers.

<p><b>Fact: 67% of companies are using machine learning, according to a recent survey!</b></p>
