   <h2>What is machine learning? </h2> 
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on 
    developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly 
    programmed. It involves the construction and study of systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make intelligent 
    decisions or predictions based on that information.
